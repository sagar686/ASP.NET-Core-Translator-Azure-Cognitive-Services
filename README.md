# ASP.NET-Core-Translator-Azure-Cognitive-Services

Prerequisites:
1. Azure subscription - Create one for free
2. Once you have an Azure subscription, create a Translator resource in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, select Go to resource.
   You'll need the key and endpoint from the resource to connect your application to the Translator service. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the      quickstart. You can use the free pricing tier (F0) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.
3. Set the subscription key and endpoint values in appSetting.json file.
